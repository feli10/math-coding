"""Solutions for 24 Game.

Some Useful Information:
1. The 24 Game is played with a deck of playing cards with all the face cards removed. Randomly
   draw 4 cards and the first player that uses all values on the cards, elementary arithmetic
   operations (+, -, *, /), and parentheses to come up with 24 wins. There are also some variants
   of this game such as using J, Q, and K or allowing more operations.
2. Given 4 numbers, the program will display all solutions that are not equivalent to each other.
3. The program uses brute force to try every arithmetic expression and uses the calc() function
   in eval_expressions.py (G421) to calculate the result of the expressions.
4. Many solutions, such as ones using commutative or associative laws, are equivalent. To check
   whether two expressions are equivalent, the 4 given numbers are mapped onto another 4 random
   numbers and the operands in the two expressions are replaced by these new numbers. If the
   results of the two expressions are still the same, they are equivalent.
5. When displaying solutions, parentheses are only used when they are required.
6. The programs can be used to solve problems similar to the 24 Game. In fact, users can enter any
   amount of any numbers and any target number (not necessarily 24) and get all non-equivalent
   solutions.
